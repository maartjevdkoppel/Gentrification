# Gentrification
Regression nalyses for "Perils of 'revitalization'? Gentrification, political participation and support for social democratic and multicultural parties in Amsterdam." The 'Data preparation' R script converts all raw data into one data file used for the empirical analysis, see the 'Main analysis' script. All data files are uploaded under 'Data'. Sources and any manual changes to these data files are detailed under 'Log of data sources + preparation.'
